// TODO customize. For now not sure which constraints will be useful for ARCE. Can they also be completely custom? Some useful ones:
//  - timeout - pass default timeouts to ArceServer
//  - sslCert - pass to ArceServer
//  - sslKey  - pass to ArceServer
//  - sessionId - seems usually given by BaseDriver. Making them constants would allow to match ArceClient sockets to sessions at some point
